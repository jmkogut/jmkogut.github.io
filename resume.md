### Experience {#experience}

Scottrageous Inc.
: *PHP Developer, Sysadmin*
  __2006-2007__
Responsible for programming backend
systems to client websites that my senior manager brought in. Setup and
maintained a Debian server throughout the duration of my job and gained valuable experience with
installing/configuring freely available CMS or blog systems like Drupal and Wordpress. Managed my own hours and
billing.

Axiom Technologies
: *Technical Support, Computer Repair, Sysadmin*
  __October 2007-August 2008__
Navigated to client offices and houses billing hourly. Incredibly dynamic job that dealt with everything from dead
network cards to faulty CPUs. I managed our hosting services in the off duty time and scored a 413 day uptime on one of my servers there. I organized the office and developed an inventory system in my spare time.
